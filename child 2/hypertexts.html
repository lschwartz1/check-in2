    <h1>Hypertexts and the Web</h1>
    <p>Hypertexts are simply words on a webpage that link to other webpages. This can be done by using the a href tag. They are helpful for bringing your audience to other bits of relevant information depending on what they are interested in or looking for. These tags are key for easy navigation through multiple pages in one website. </p>
